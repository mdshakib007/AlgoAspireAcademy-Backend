## Understand Your Business Requirements

-   **Identify the Core Features:**  
    For AlgoAspire Academy, consider features such as:
    
    -   **User Management:** Registration, profiles, achievements.
    -   **Courses and Lessons:** Courses with multiple lessons/modules.
    -   **Video Content:** Videos embedded from YouTube.
    -   **Notes & Discussions:** Personal notes, topic-wise notes, Q&A.
    -   **Progress Tracking:** Tracking course completion, quiz scores.
    -   **Gamification:** Points, leaderboards, badges.
-   **Determine Data Usage Patterns:**  
    Think about read-heavy operations (e.g., loading courses, videos) and write operations (e.g., posting notes or questions).
    

----------

## Identify the Key Entities

Based on the features, your system might include entities such as:

-   **User:** Stores user details, authentication data, profile information.
-   **Course:** Contains information about a course (title, description, etc.).
-   **Lesson/Module:** Each course is broken down into lessons or modules.
-   **Video:** Details about each video (URL, title, duration, associated lesson).
-   **Note:** User-generated notes attached to videos or lessons.
-   **Question/Answer:** For Q&A sessions related to course content.
-   **Progress:** Tracks user progress, points earned, and course completion.
-   **Achievement/Badge:** For gamification and milestones.

----------

## Define Relationships Between Entities

-   **One-to-Many Relationships:**
    -   **Course** → **Lessons:** One course can have many lessons.
    -   **Lesson** → **Videos:** One lesson can include multiple videos.
    -   **User** → **Notes:** One user can create many notes.
    -   **User** → **Questions/Answers:** One user can post multiple questions or answers.
-   **Many-to-Many Relationships:**
    -   **User** ↔ **Courses:** A user can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have many enrolled users.
    -   Use a join table (e.g., Enrollment) to manage this relationship.

----------

## Plan for Normalization and Scalability

-   **Normalization:**
    
    -   Aim for at least 3NF (Third Normal Form) to avoid data redundancy.
    -   Ensure each table has a primary key and that foreign keys properly enforce relationships.
-   **Indexing:**
    
    -   Identify columns that are frequently searched or joined (like user IDs, course IDs) and add indexes to improve performance.
-   **Scalability Considerations:**
    
    -   **Partitioning:** For very large tables, consider partitioning data.
    -   **Caching:** Use caching layers (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
    -   **Replication:** Use database replicas to balance read operations.
    -   **Denormalization (where needed):** For read-heavy operations, selectively denormalize parts of your data to reduce join complexity, but balance this against data consistency.


## Define Vision and Goals

-   **Vision:**  
    Create a comprehensive, free e-learning platform that aggregates course videos, notes, and interactive features to boost learner engagement and motivation.
    
-   **Primary Goals:**
    
    -   Central hub for algorithm courses (videos, notes, Q&A).
    -   Foster community learning with notes sharing, questions, and a leaderboard.
    -   Gamification to reward progress (points, ranking).
    -   Integrate modern AI tools (like ChatGPT) for real-time help.

----------
